            The Jesuits are a religious order of priests and brothers serving in
            the Catholic Church. Founded by St Ignatius and his companions in
            the 1540 they have spread across the globe. They desire to serve
            Christ under the banner of the cross. Doing more (MAGIS) for the
            greater glory of God is their motto in life.

            Jesuits by heart are companions of Jesus. By profession they are
            engineers, farmers, retreat directors, teachers, doctors, poets,
            lawyers, social workers, writers, administrators, professors,
            pastors, scientists, artists and many moreâ€¦.
            <br /> The Bombay Province Jesuits work with all people without any
            barrier of any type. Every human is a child of God. The thrust of
            their work is spiritual nourishment of the faithful, upliftment of
            the marginalized, social justice activities, inter-religious
            dialogue, accompanying youth and other ministries.
