              would come, about 70% of the 500 people present raised their
              hands. He fixed the following Saturday as the day on which they
              would go out to help. When the day came, five people turned up.
              They said, but did not do. They had words but no action.

              Life is unpredictable and uncertain. So-called good, gentle person

              In the famous discussion with the Samaritan woman near the well,
              Jesus speaks of living water, which quenches the thirst (John
              4:1â€“15, NRSV). Interestingly one who offered the living water, and
              the one who turned the water into wine is thirsty during the
              passion. What are some of the explanations?
