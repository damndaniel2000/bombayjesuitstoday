              Jesus renames Simon as Peter, which means â€˜Rockâ€™ â€“ the foundation
              on which he will build his Church. He is chosen as a leader, but
              he and the others are to be the Church, the community, who will be
              called to feed the multitudes and bring them Godâ€™s compassion.

              Today on the feast of the Queenship of Mary, I wish to focus our
              attention to the gender inequality, which is prevalent even today.
              In many traditional families, men behave like scribes and
              Pharisees, unwilling to lift even a finger to help the women in
              the works of the house.

              In the famous discussion with the Samaritan woman near the well,
              Jesus speaks of living water, which quenches the thirst (John
              4:1â€“15, NRSV). Interestingly one who offered the living water, and
              the one who turned the water into wine is thirsty during the
              passion. What are some of the explanations?
