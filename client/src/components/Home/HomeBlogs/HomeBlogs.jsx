              Jesus renames Simon as Peter, which means â€˜Rockâ€™ â€“ the foundation
              on which he will build his Church. He is chosen as a leader, but
              he and the others are to be the Church, the community, who will be
              called to feed the multitudes and bring them Godâ€™s compassion.

              The beatitudes in the Gospel of Luke are very concrete. They are
              addressed directly to the disciples in the second person plural.
              The disciples are poor, hungry, and weeping right now in the
              present. "When" clause (certain future) is mentioned regarding
              impending persecution, put as an exhortation to rejoice in the
              face of persecution.

              In the famous discussion with the Samaritan woman near the well,
              Jesus speaks of living water, which quenches the thirst (John
              4:1â€“15, NRSV). Interestingly one who offered the living water, and
              the one who turned the water into wine is thirsty during the
              passion. What are some of the explanations?
